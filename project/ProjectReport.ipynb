    "\n",
    "In this section, import images are resized and cropped to keep the most important part of images. However, we can't determine a uniform method for all datasets and models. The users might need to change the size range and cropping range before using it.\n",

    "\n",
    "This section uses a lot of exising functions like **to_categorical()** and **train_test_split()** to achieve various processing methods. The functionality of subtracting mean RGB values is built by meself since the methods provided in existing packages are quite different and it's hard to determine which one is consistent with my aim.\n",

    "### Data augmentation\n",

    "This project focuses on the preprocessing of cloud images for deep learning models. The output from this project including data-preprocessing module and fucntions can be applied to the task for other objects easily in the future, since in most cases similar procedures of import, processing and augmentation should be went through before inputing the data into deep learning models. To complete this work, we need to determine the new best cropping range and image shape, and add new data augmentation methods.   \n",
    "In this project, some test_functions are defined to test the returns of 4 new written functions. They have determined the functions run without mistakes and return expected variables. However, the finally returned data generators should be applied into a true training task of deep learning models in order to examine the actual performance of this data-preprocessing module, which is impossible to test by test_fucntions. This is an important future work for improve the module and find better data-processing methods. For example:\n",
